  Intelligent design brief router. Takes any design request and emits a structured
  routing plan — which skills to load, in what order, with what focus parameters.
  Always load this skill FIRST when receiving a design brief. It is the entry point
  for the entire modular design system.
  Trigger on: "design a", "create UI for", "branding for", "what should it look like",
  "color scheme for", "design brief", "visual identity", "/design", intent=design_brief.

# Design Mapper Skill

**Entry point for the modular design system.** Load this first on any design brief.
It reads the brief, detects signals, and emits a routing plan. The agent then loads
each linked skill in the specified order, carrying context forward.

## The Skill Network

```
design-mapper-skill  ← you are here (always load first)
        │
        ├─► color-combo-skill      (palette, mood, roles)
        ├─► design-effects-skill   (morphism, motion, elevation, effects)
        ├─► font-pairing-skill     (typeface, scale, pairing archetype)
        └─► icon-system-skill      (library, weight, style, animated)
```

Skills are independent but the mapper sequences them and passes carryover context
so each skill builds on the choices made before it.

---

## On First Load

When this skill is first loaded in a new session, before processing any design brief:

1. **Announce the system** in one sentence: "I've loaded design-mapper-skill — the entry point for a modular design system."
2. **Offer the companion skills** — ask the user once:

   > "The full system includes 4 companion skills. Want me to install them now?
   > - **color-combo-skill** — 161 palettes, WCAG contrast ratios, CSS custom property templates
   > - **design-effects-skill** — glass morphism, animation, page-type recipes
   > - **font-pairing-skill** — typeface pairing, type scale, loading strategy
   > - **icon-system-skill** — icon library selection, optical sizing, currentColor"

3. **If the user says yes**, run each command:
   ```bash
   npx skills add bilioveloso/color-combo-skill
   npx skills add bilioveloso/design-effects-skill
   npx skills add bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill
   npx skills add bilioveloso/icon-system-skill
   ```
4. **If the user says no**, proceed. The mapper will fetch companion skills from the web when routing — installation is optional.

**Only ask once per session.** If a design brief was already given before the skill loaded, skip the prompt and go straight to routing.

---

## Auto Mode (default on)

After emitting the DESIGN ROUTE block, **automatically load and apply each non-skipped skill in order.** Do not wait for the user to trigger each one manually.

**Source priority for each skill:**
1. Installed locally → read from `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Not installed → fetch from the raw URL below

| Skill | Raw URL |
|---|---|
| color-combo-skill | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilioveloso/color-combo-skill/main/SKILL.md` |
| design-effects-skill | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilioveloso/design-effects-skill/main/SKILL.md` |
| font-pairing-skill | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilioveloso/font-pairing-skill/main/SKILL.md` |
| icon-system-skill | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilioveloso/icon-system-skill/main/SKILL.md` |

Pass the carryover context from the route when applying each skill (see Carryover Context Rules below).

**To disable auto mode:** If the user says "just route, don't apply" or "route only" — emit the DESIGN ROUTE block and stop. The user can then trigger each skill manually.

---

## How to Use This Skill

When you receive a design brief:

1. **Detect signals** from the brief using the Signal Detectors below.
2. **Resolve the route** using the Routing Table.
3. **Emit the Design Route block** (template at the end).
4. **Auto mode:** load each non-skipped skill in order, reading the carryover notes before each one.
5. **Skip any skill** that has a skip condition (listed per skill below).

Do not ask clarifying questions before emitting the route. Emit the best route you
can from the brief, then offer to adjust.

| web app, SaaS, dashboard | → design-effects: glass OK, elevation-heavy layouts OK |
| landing page, marketing site | → design-effects: hero gradient + scroll motion focus |
| print, poster, packaging | → skip design-effects (motion irrelevant); font-pairing: display-weight emphasis |
| dark mode required | → apply dark variant of chosen palette; design-effects: glass morphism preferred |
| accessibility priority | → override accent choices that fail WCAG AAA; flag in route |
| already has brand colors | → skip color-combo; start at design-effects |
| already has fonts chosen | → skip font-pairing |
| icon-free context (text content, doc) | → skip icon-system |

---

## Skip Conditions

| Skill | Skip when |
|---|---|
| color-combo-skill | Brief already specifies exact brand colors |
| design-effects-skill | Platform is print/poster/packaging; or brief is purely typographic |
| font-pairing-skill | Brief already specifies exact typefaces |
| icon-system-skill | No UI components involved (branding only, editorial, print) |

---

## Carryover Context Rules

### color-combo → design-effects
- **Warm palette** (Rustic, Tropical, Retro) → prefer soft elevation, warm shadows, no cold glass
- **Dark palette** (Gothic, Gaming, Otherworldly) → glass morphism strongly preferred; high-contrast borders
- **Corporate palette** → flat or subtle elevation only; no glass; clean dividers
- **Minimalist palette** → zero decoration; solid fills only; no gradients in components

### color-combo → font-pairing
- **Luxury palette** → serif display or high-contrast didone pairing
- **Minimalist palette** → geometric sans, mono optionally for accents
- **Rustic / Craft palette** → slab serif or humanist serif
- **Corporate palette** → humanist sans (Inter, Source Sans), no decorative
- **Gothic palette** → high-contrast serif or editorial condensed
- **Otherworldly / Gaming** → geometric sans or display mono; avoid humanist

### design-effects → icon-system
- **Glass morphism active** → icons need heavier weight (stroke 2px+) to show through blur
- **Flat design** → icons should be stroke-only, light (1.5px), consistent weight
- **Dark background** → prefer filled or outlined icons with high contrast; avoid 1px strokes
- **Animated effects active** → consider animated icons (Lordicon / Lottie) for key interactive moments

## Industry Anti-Patterns

Specific things that kill credibility or trust in each context. These override general taste — they are non-negotiable.

| Industry / Context | Avoid |
|---|---|
| SaaS (General) | Excessive animation · Dark mode by default |
| B2B / Enterprise | AI purple/pink gradients · Playful design · Hidden credentials |
| Healthcare / Medical | Bright neon · Motion-heavy animations · AI purple/pink gradients |
| Banking / Traditional Finance | Playful design · Poor security UX · AI purple/pink gradients |
| Fintech / Crypto | Playful design · Unclear fees · AI purple/pink gradients |
| Legal Services | AI purple/pink gradients · Outdated design · Hidden credentials |
| Insurance | AI purple/pink gradients · No trust signals · Confusing pricing |
| Government / Public Service | Ornate design · Low contrast · Motion effects · AI purple/pink gradients |
| E-commerce Luxury | Vibrant & Block-based · Playful colors · Fast animations |
| Mental Health App | Bright neon · Motion overload |
| Beauty / Spa / Wellness | Bright neon · Dark mode · Harsh animations |
| Gaming / Esports | Minimalist design · Static assets |
| Kids / Education | Dark modes · Complex jargon · Muted colors |
| Senior Care / Elderly | Small text · Complex navigation · AI purple/pink gradients |
| Developer Tool / IDE | Light mode by default · Slow performance |
| AI / Chatbot Platform | Heavy chrome · Slow response feedback |
| Logistics / Delivery | Static tracking · No map integration · AI purple/pink gradients |
| Restaurant / Cafe | Low-quality imagery · Outdated hours |
| Photography Studio | Heavy text · Poor image showcase |
| Medical Clinic / Pharma | Confusing booking · Privacy concerns · AI purple/pink gradients |
| NFT / Web3 | Light mode default · No transaction status feedback |
| Podcast Platform | Poor audio player · Cluttered layout |
| Dating App | Generic profiles · No safety features visible |
| News / Media | Cluttered layout · Slow loading |
| Food Delivery | Muted colors · Low energy |
| Fitness / Gym | Static design · No gamification |

**"AI purple/pink gradients"** — the gradient style from AI branding (purple→pink mesh) is now associated with generic AI products. Avoid it in finance, healthcare, legal, government, and enterprise contexts where it signals "not serious."
